        <p>The OIA is committed to our Prime Minister's vision of "Surakshit Jaayen, Prashikshit Jaayen"

The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, has emphasized the importance of upskilling the Indian workforce to capitalize on the growing global job opportunities. The Office of International Affairs plays a crucial role in this endeavor by facilitating the training and placement of Indian skilled manpower in various countries, thereby contributing to India's ambition of becoming the skill capital of the world. The OIA recognizes the need to align the skills of the Indian workforce with the demands of the global job market. By collaborating with industry and academic institutions, the OIA is working to transform the industry-academia relationship into a convergence of interests, positioning India as a global innovation hub. We recognizes the importance of upskilling the Indian workforce to capitalize on the growing global job opportunities, aligning their competencies with the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF). This aligns with the government's vision of making India the world's skill capital.</p>
